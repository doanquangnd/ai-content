# AI Content - AI Assistant for Botble CMS 🤖✨

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: This plugin was entirely created by AI!** 
> 
> Yes, you read that right. A machine wrote this code in 2 hours. Whether that's impressive or terrifying is up for debate, but here we are. 🤷‍♂️

## What is this thing? 🤔

AI Content is a **simplified fork** of the Vig-AI plugin, because sometimes less is more (and sometimes you just want to avoid the complexity of image generation and inline editing). 

**Key differences from the original:**
- ❌ No AI image generation (because we're keeping it simple, folks) - *not because I don't know how to do it, trust me bro* 😏
- ❌ No inline editing (who needs that anyway?)
- ✅ Just pure, unadulterated text generation
- ✅ Completely rewritten by AI (because why not?)

## Features that might actually be useful 🚀

- **Content Generation**: Create blog posts, product descriptions, category content, and more with the power of AI
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, and Google Gemini APIs
  - *Note: I've only tested OpenAI and Gemini because Claude API costs money, and I'm not made of money* 💸
- **Customizable Prompts**: Create your own prompt templates because one size doesn't fit all
- **Streaming Responses**: Watch your content being generated in real-time (it's like watching paint dry, but more exciting)

## System Requirements 📋

- **PHP**: 8.0 or higher (because we're not savages)
- **Botble CMS**: 6.0 or higher (obviously)
- **API Keys**: From OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, or Google Gemini
- **Patience**: Lots of it, because AI can be... unpredictable

## Installation 🛠️

### Method 1: Via Admin Panel (The Easy Way)

1. Go to **Admin → Plugins → Add New**
2. Find "AI Content" in the plugin list
3. Click **Install** button
4. Click **Activate** button (because installed plugins don't activate themselves, apparently)

### Method 2: Manual Installation (For the Brave)

1. Download the plugin from Botble Marketplace
2. Extract the zip file (because compression is a thing)
3. Copy the `ai-content` folder to your `platform/plugins` directory
4. Go to **Admin → Plugins** and activate it
5. Pat yourself on the back for doing it the hard way

## Configuration ⚙️

### API Setup

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → AI Content**
2. Enter your API key for the provider you want to use
3. For API Model field, you can leave it empty or specify your preferred model
4. Click **Save** (this step is crucial, don't forget it)

### Prompt Templates

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → AI Content → Prompt Template**
2. Create new templates or edit existing ones
3. Get creative with your prompts (but keep it clean, folks)

## How to Use 🎯

### Generating Content Automatically

1. Go to **Posts/Products → Create/Edit**
2. Look for the **"Generate with AI"** button (it's there, I promise)
3. Select your prompt template
4. Enter your keyword/topic
5. Click **"Generate"** and wait for the AI magic to happen
6. Marvel at the results (or cry, depending on the quality)

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Common Issues

- **"No providers configured"**: You forgot to add API keys. Shocking, I know.
- **"Rate limit exceeded"**: You're making too many requests. Slow down, turbo.
- **"Connection timeout"**: Check your internet connection (or blame the AI provider)
- **Weird HTML in output**: The AI got confused. Try a different prompt or provider.

### Tips for Better Results

- Be specific with your prompts
- Don't expect Shakespeare-level writing from AI
- Test different providers if one isn't working well
- Remember: AI is a tool, not a replacement for human creativity
